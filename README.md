## Job Tracker with reminders
  ### Description
  - MVC ASP .net applicaiton
  - Tracks current projects, jobs and requirements for work.
    ### Required Features
       - Ticket system style job tracking
       - Reminder notifications for tasks
       - Time for task tracking
        
    ### Nice to have Features
      - Export to CORE invoice database
      - Central notes section for each job task
      - general notes for the week per user
      - Voice to Text for notes & reminders
          Example: state Remind me that I need to do task tomorrow at 4pm.  (Sets reminder for 4pm about task)
      - Reminder mode ADHD vs Non-ADHD
           (ADHD mode for reminders sets a 15min, 1 hour before and 24 hours before notification for all reminders set)
            All reminder modes adjustable as desired.  Including # of reminders and timing of those reminders.  Default as above for ADHD reminders.
            Non-ADHD reminders is 15 minutes before event only.
      - on site tracking start and stop
          Example: Arrive on site, state Start Tracking for "Client Name".  Tracks total time at client
                  Start Tracking 'task name', Starts tim tracking for that task. (rounds up to the nearest fifteen minute interval)

  ### Structured Learning Path for DSP in C++ for Audio Applications

1. **Foundations of DSP**:
   - Start with online courses like "Introduction to Digital Signal Processing" on platforms like Coursera or edX. Look for courses with video lectures to accommodate your auditory learning preference.
   - Supplement with textbooks like "Understanding Digital Signal Processing" by Richard G. Lyons, which often come with companion websites offering audiovisual resources.

2. **Hands-on Practice**:
   - Utilize DSP software tools such as MATLAB or Octave for initial experimentation. These platforms often have built-in functions for audio processing and visualization.
   - Explore online tutorials and interactive platforms like MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox or online DSP simulation tools.

3. **C++ and DSP Integration**:
   - Transition to applying DSP concepts in C++ by studying resources like "Digital Signal Processing Using C++" by Baba A. Issa. This book offers practical examples and exercises in C++.
   - Implement basic DSP algorithms (e.g., filtering, Fourier transforms) in C++ from scratch to solidify understanding.

4. **Audio-Specific DSP Concepts**:
   - Dive deeper into audio-specific DSP concepts like audio synthesis, effects processing, and sampling theory.
   - Explore resources like "Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++" by Will Pirkle, which bridges DSP theory with practical implementation using the JUCE Framework.

5. **JUCE Framework and Synth Development**:
   - Start learning the JUCE Framework, which is widely used for audio application development. Resources include the official JUCE documentation, online tutorials, and courses.
   - Experiment with building simple audio applications, starting with basic synthesizers and effects plugins.
   - Explore the Synth Minilogue XD's documentation and tutorials to understand its architecture and programming interface.

6. **Integration with Ableton and Real-World Projects**:
   - Learn how to integrate JUCE-based audio applications with Ableton Live using protocols like MIDI and OSC.
   - Explore open-source projects or contribute to existing ones related to audio processing and synthesis, such as plugins or software synthesizers.
   - Participate in online forums and communities like the JUCE forum or Stack Overflow to seek advice and collaborate with other audio programmers.

7. **Continuous Learning and Projects**:
   - Continuously explore advanced DSP topics and techniques through online resources, books, and academic papers.
   - Work on personal projects or contribute to open-source audio software to reinforce learning and build a portfolio.
   - Regularly experiment with audio programming and DSP concepts to maintain proficiency and creativity.
